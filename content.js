Then, the TensorFlow.js library <a href='https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/body-pix target='_blank'>BodyPix</a> was applied to each image, using machine learning and computer vision to accurately segment bodies.<br><br><img class='small-img' src='/images/obaa4.png'/><br><br> The cumulative web app captures a user’s body, with the BodyPix library segmenting the image with user correction.
